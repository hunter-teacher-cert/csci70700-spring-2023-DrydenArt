- NOTE:  both of my HW solutions are run from main.py but you will find my notes for part two in the transposition.py file linked below


*** Additional Files:
- HOMEWORK PART 2: 'ENCRYPTION' written in transposition.py: https://replit.com/@DrydenArt/Encryption#transposition.py
- Copy of code-along done in class: caesar_encryption.py: https://replit.com/@DrydenArt/Encryption#caesar_encryption.py
  
*** Additional Notes:
- For HW part 2, I originally made a specific key to allocate the number of colunms my message would be broken into
- I wanted to see if I could you the random.randrange() to generate a new key each time (see notes in transposition.py)
- It was fun to re-run the code to see the various ways the message was broken up, but I realize it may not be the best approach to encryption :0)
